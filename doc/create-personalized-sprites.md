# Tutorial for creating personalized fighting character sprites

> **Labels**: Phase-Support

## Introduction

The idea behind the Java Fighting Game engine is to create your own personalized fighting game characters, e.g. you and your friends, and assemble them together into a playable game. Creating your own fighting game sprites may sound a lot of work but the results are often worth it since the creation process is quite straightforward.

## Before you start

Before you can start creating your own sprites, be sure to have the following things ready:

- Digital Video Camera  
- Camera Stand  
- Video and Image Processing Tools  
  - [Avidemux Video Processing](http://avidemux.org/)  
  - [The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)](http://www.gimp.org/)

## Find proper location

You need to find a proper location to take videos for your own fighting characters. In theory, there aren't any limitations on where you take your videos, but best practice is to record in front of a planar wall. In our case, we take our videos in the basement where we've got enough space for our fighter improvisations.

## Fighting character states

After setting up your camera environment, you can start creating your own character sprites. Often fighters stick to a predefined fighting style, e.g., Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat.

You can use the following character states for your inspiration:

- **Basic Moves**  
  - Stand  
  - Block  
  - High Punch  
  - Low Punch  
  - Uppercut  
  - High Kick  
  - Low Kick  
  - High Hit  
  - Low Hit  

- **Jumping Moves**  
  - Jump  
  - Jump Punch  
  - Jump Kick  
  - Jump Forward  

- **Crouching Moves**  
  - Duck  
  - Duck Block  
  - Duck Punch  
  - Duck Kick  
  - Duck Hit  
  - Sweeper
